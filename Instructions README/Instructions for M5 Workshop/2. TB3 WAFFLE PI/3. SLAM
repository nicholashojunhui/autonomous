For Virtual SLAM (one TB3), 4 Steps:

Step 1 - Launch Gazebo in TurtleBot3 World

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

Step 2a - Launch SLAM in a new terminal

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping

*Note that if your SLAM module donâ€™t work, close all terminals, install it in a new terminal:
- $ sudo apt install ros-noetic-slam-gmapping
- Restart from Step 1

Step 3a - Activate Autonomous Navigation in a new terminal (only works for simulation!):

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch

*Note that you can choose to do this manually (i.e. Teleop key node):
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

Step 4 - Save the Map once Completed in a new terminal:

$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/TB3_WORLD
