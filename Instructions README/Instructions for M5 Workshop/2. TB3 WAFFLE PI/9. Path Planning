[Path Planning]:

1. Open terminal and type:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

2. Open new terminal and type:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/TB3_WORLD.yaml

*Ensure you still have the map that you have saved previously in the HOME directory

3. After RViz is launched, initiate the pose estimate manually or via python file execution

4. Open new terminal and type:

$ rosrun autonomous path_planning.py

OR 

$ rosrun autonomous path_planning2.py

*ensure that your python codes are in the src folder of your autonomous package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x path_planning.py)

5. Observe in the RViz application and/or Gazebo that the TB3 will first move to the 1st waypoint, later move to the 2nd waypoint, and back to the 1st; this behaviour will be looped until the file stops running (clt c)
