***IMPORTANT POINTERS***

Note if your TB3 cannot maneuverer properly due to narrow corners, you may need to tune the navigation parameters.



[1. Changing Costmap Parameters]:

File can be found in the navigation package to change the params:

turtlebot3_navigation/param/costmap_common_params_waffle_pi.yaml

- Low inflation radius reduce allowable distance between the TB3 and obstacles
- Low cost scaling factor ensures that the TB3 move in between the centre of obstacles as much as possible

Under "costmap_common_params_waffle_pi.yaml" file, change the following param values

inflation_radius: 0.23
cost_scaling_factor: 2.0



[2. Changing DWA Local Planner Parameters]:

File can be found in the navigation package to change the params:

turtlebot3_navigation/param/dwa_local_planner_params_waffle_pi.yaml

- path_distance_bias = The weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given
- goal_distance_bias = The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to reach its local goal, also controls speed
- occdist_scale = The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to avoid obstacles

Under "dwa_local_planner_params_waffle_pi.yaml" file, change the following param values

path_distance_bias: 1.0
goal_distance_bias: 2.0
occdist_scale: 0.01

- New parameters will help you reduce allowances for the planned paths
