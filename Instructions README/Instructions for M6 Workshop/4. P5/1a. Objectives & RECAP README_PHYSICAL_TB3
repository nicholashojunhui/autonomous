[Three Objectives]:

1. “Pick” an item from the startpoint

2. Move the TB3 base (together with the OM and "item") to the endpoint ONLY with the help of the RGB camera

3. “Place” the item at the endpoint

4. Reflect on the project (with the help of the given reflection questions)

*Note, you DO NOT need to perform SLAM for this project as you are only using the yellow line as a guide to move



[RECAP]:

You have to BRINGUP your TB3 with OM (2 BRINGUPs to execute) first before you launch the launch file, Project5.launch; Example:

1. On the Remote PC, run roscore (Important: do NOT run roscore under the TB3 PC!!!)

$ roscore

2. On the Remote PC, open new terminal and type the following commands to access TB3 PC:

$ ssh ubuntu@192.168.XX.XX

You will see in this terminal that you are connected to the pi’s terminal

3. On the TB3 PC (using the linked pi terminal), type the following to bring up basic packages to start TB3:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch

4. On the Remote PC, open new terminal and type the following commands to access TB3 PC:

$ ssh ubuntu@192.168.XX.XX

5. Activate rpicamera

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_rpicamera.launch

6. Compressed image should be transform to raw image:

$ rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=raspicam_node/image raw out:=raspicam_node/image

7. On the Remote PC, run Bringup node for OM on TB3 (on new terminal):

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_bringup turtlebot3_manipulation_bringup.launch

8. Execute launch file to execute required tasks [i.e. (A) Activate the MANIPULATION node (i.e. move_group node) to get ready the OM for use, (B) Use the OM to “pick” the item from startpoint; assume this action remains the same as the “pick, move, place” example, (C) Bring the TB3 with OM (together with the “item”) to the endpoint ONLY with the help of the RGB camera, and (D) Use the OM to “place” the item at the endpoint; assume this action remains the same as the “pick, move, place” example]

$ roslaunch autonomous Project5.launch


*** Meaning you are only required to type 1 command line to perform the given tasks

*ensure that your python code(s) are in the src folder of your autonomous package
*ensure that your launch file(s) are in the launch folder of your autonomous package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_python_codes.py)
