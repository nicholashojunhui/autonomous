[Three Objectives]:

1. “Pick” an item from the startpoint

2. Move the TB3 base (together with the OM and "item") to the endpoint ONLY with the help of the RGB camera

3. Reflect on the project (with the help of the given reflection questions)



[Map to be used for P5]:

line2.world (same as Line Follower Example)

*Note, you DO NOT need to perform SLAM for this project as you are only using the yellow line as a guide to move



[RECAP]:

You have to launch your Gazebo first (to load TB3 in the line.world) first before you launch the launch file, Project5.launch; Example:

1. Launch Gazebo (to load TB3 in the line.world)

$ roslaunch autonomous line2.launch

2. Execute launch file to execute required tasks [i.e. (A) Activate the MANIPULATION node (i.e. move_group node) to get ready the OM for use, (B) Use the OM to “pick” the item from startpoint; assume this action remains the same
as the “pick, move, place” example, and (C) Bring the TB3 with OM (together with the “item”) to the endpoint ONLY with the help of the RGB camera]

$ roslaunch autonomous Project5_2.launch


*** Meaning you are only required to type 2 command lines on 2 separate terminals to perform the given tasks

*ensure that your python code(s) are in the src folder of your autonomous package
*ensure that your launch file(s) are in the launch folder of your autonomous package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_python_codes.py)
