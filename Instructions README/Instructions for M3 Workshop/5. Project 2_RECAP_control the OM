Note for Project 2:

- For Manual Control, use the current OpenCR configuration. Use the RC100 controller as explained in the slides

- For Hand Guiding, use the current OpenCR configuration. Refer to the explanations in the slides and/or README instructions

- For FK/IK Techniques, use the ROS configuration; remember to reconfigure and upload the correct firmware using Arduino. You can use the given Project2.py as a reference template for this part

################# RECAP on procedures to rosrun #################

1. Run roscore on one terminal
$ roscore

2. Prepare the setup for the OM: Connect the wires, switch on the power, and manually bring up the OM

3. On another terminal, activate the controller; this will lock the motors
$ roslaunch open_manipulator_controller open_manipulator_controller.launch

4. On another terminal, ROSRUN/ROSLAUNCH your codes
$ rosrun autonomous Project2.py 

(for FK/IK)
*ensure that your codes are in the src folder of your autonomous package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_codes.py)
