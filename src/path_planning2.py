# You need to know the coordinates that the map you are working
# in is. I estimated these numbers using the turtlebot3_world
# map from Turtlebot3. The center of the map is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0); each grid is 1m.

# Quaternions are a different mathematical represetnation 
# for "euler angles", roll, pitch and yaw (RPY).
# below shows how to convert Euler angles (i.e. RPY) to Quaternions
# Note that for the TB3, only the Yaw component is needed
# Change theta to change the orientation of the TB3. E.g. 0 degrees is facing front, 90 degrees is facing left and -90 degress is facing right

#theta in degrees
theta1 = 90
yaw_radians1 = theta1 * (math.pi/180)

theta2 = -90
yaw_radians2 = theta2 * (math.pi/180)

# in order RPY
q1 = quaternion_from_euler(0, 0, yaw_radians1)
q2 = quaternion_from_euler(0, 0, yaw_radians2)

#The first waypoint array is x,y,z location. 
#The second one is a "quaternion" defining an orientation.
